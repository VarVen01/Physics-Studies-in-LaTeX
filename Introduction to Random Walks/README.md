# An Introduction to Random Walks

# Overview
This project explores the concept of random walks, a foundational idea in probability theory and statistical mechanics with applications across physics, finance, biology, and computer science, to name a few. A random walk is a mathematical process that describes a path of steps chosen in random directions. In this repository, the mathematical theory behind random walks is introduced, as well as an explanation of its core concepts. It is intended to assist readers seeking a basic conceptual understanding of how randomness influences movement and decision-making over time.

# Topics Covered
- The One-Dimensional Random Walk: exploring various mathematical approaches to understand the simplest case of the random walk and how to model it
- The Gaussian: explaining the statistical principles behind the random walk; properties of the normal distribution and the consequences of the central limit theorem
- Brownian Motion and the Diffusion Equation: a look into one of the most familiar random walk problems present in nature and Einstein's approach to solving it in 1905, including detailed explanations of the equations Einstein derived
- Introduction to Applications and Next Steps: a list of examples related to the random walk in real life, as well as future research and project ideas based on the ideas presented in this paper
