# Maxwell's Equations: A Visual and Mathematical Derivation Booklet

## Overview
This LaTeX booklet is specifically designed to go beyond formulas simply stated in a textbook or class and instead focus on mathematical intuition based on experimental evidence, accompanied by clean visuals. It derives both the integral and differential forms of each of Maxwell's four equations from first principles. By combining vector calculus with diagrams and structured explanations, this project aims to show why these equations are not just formulas but rather insights into how electromagnetics behaves. These equations, derived naturally from field behavior and symmetry, unified electricity and magnetism and laid the mathematical foundation for technologies from MRI to radio.
