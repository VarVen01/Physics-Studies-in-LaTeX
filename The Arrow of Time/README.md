# The Arrow of Time: A Research Summary

# Overview
This repository contains a concise and comprehensive summary of research on the arrow of time, exploring its physical, thermodynamic, and quantum aspects. From Stephen Hawking’s three arrows of time to the latest discoveries in quantum mechanics, this paper aims to make sense of one of physics’ most profound questions: Why does time seem to flow in one direction when the fundamental physical laws are time-symmetric?

# Topics Covered
- Hawking's Three Arrows of Time: thermodynamic, psychological, and cosmological perspectives on time's directionality
- Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: the most common explanation for the arrow of time; how the tendency of states towards disorder creates a thermodynamic arrow of time
- Time and the Big Bang: how the formation of the universe relates to the arrow of time, as well as the anthropic principle
- The Quantum Arrow of Time: ideas relating to the arrow of time at the quantum level and whether quantum mechanics is necessarily time-asymmetric or not
- Recent Findings: a look at current research suggests two distinct and opposing arrows of time at the quantum level; a summary of these findings and their implications, as well as further questions
